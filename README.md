Welcome to the Slide Pilot Server repository! This guide will walk you through setting up and running the Slide Pilot server to enable remote presentation control using the Slide Pilot client application.

## Overview

Slide Pilot allows you to control presentations from your Android device, providing features such as slide navigation, spotlight functionality, cursor control, and more. The server component is essential for connecting your mobile device to your computer and requires the installation of specific software.

## All-In-One Archive

To simplify the setup process, we've bundled all necessary software into a single All-In-One archive. This archive includes:

1. Java Installer: Required to run the server application.

2. Slide Pilot Server (Portable): The main server application (a JAR file).

3. PowerToys Installer: Necessary for enabling the Spotlight function.
